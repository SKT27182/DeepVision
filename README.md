## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of various Computer Vision Architectures from scratch using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The implementations are done in a modular fashion, so that the individual components of the architectures can be used in other projects.

## Architectures

###  [LeNet](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf): This is the first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture proposed by Yann LeCun in 1998. It was used to classify handwritten digits. The architecture consists of three convolutional layers, two subsampling layers, and three fully connected layers. For more details, refer to the [LeNet](Notes/LeNet.md) notes.
